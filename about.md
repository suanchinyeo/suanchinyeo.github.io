I used to do lab stuff and computer stuff to figure out biological, cancerous stuff at the Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute. I now code, run, jiujitsu, read, and knit in addition to other life sustaining activities.

Here is where I blog about some of my projects with R, Python, and other things I learn along the way.
